# DjangoHostSample
This project is intended for the demonstration of deploying django application in ubuntu 20.04
This guide is a walk-through on how to setup Ubuntu Server for hosting Django websites. The Django stack that will be used in this guide is Ubuntu, Nginx, and Gunicorn. This stack was chosen solely because from the reading I've done these seems to be one of the latest "standard" stacks for Django deployment. This guide also assumes that you're familiar with Ubuntu server administration and Django. Also of note, this is the sample code used for deploying demonstrated in the blog
